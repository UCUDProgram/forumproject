# forumproject
This project was an assignment for a University of Delaware class, CPEG 470 - Web Applications Security

This assignment involved creating a forum with role-based access controls. In this role-based access controls, each user category has specific, unique behavior.  This was developed using a LAMP Stack approach, where the MySQL Database was replaced with sqlite database. This assignment serves as the basis for understanding and developing a website with multiple types of users and managing what each type of user can and con not do.
