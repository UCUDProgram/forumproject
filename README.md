# forumproject
This project was an assignment for a University of Delaware class, CPEG 470 - Web Applications Security

This assignment involved creating a forum with role-based access controls. In this role-based access controls, each user category has specific, unique behavior and would be enforced through the user's login of their account.   This was developed using a LAMP Stack approach, where the MySQL Database was replaced with sqlite database. This assignment serves as the basis for understanding and developing a website with multiple types of users and managing what each type of user can and con not do.

The link below is to this active project, so you can see the behavior of the website, running in realtime.
